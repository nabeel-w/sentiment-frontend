## Installation

### Prerequisites

-   **Node.js** (v22 or higher)
-   **npm** (Node Package Manager)

### Step 1: Install dependencies

Navigate to the `sentiment-frontend` directory (if you have a separate directory for frontend) and install the required dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

This will install all the necessary dependencies listed in `package.json`.

### Step 2: Start the React development server

Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the React development server with the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will run the React application in development mode. By default, it will be accessible at `http://localhost:5173` in your browser.
